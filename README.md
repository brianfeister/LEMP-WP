Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments.

By providing automated creation and provisioning of virtual machines using [Oracleâ€™s VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org),
Vagrant provides the tools to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable
virtual environments. For more information, see the part of the getting started guide
on [Why Vagrant?](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/why.html)

## Quick Start

First, make sure your development machine has [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org)
installed (version 4.2 and later are preferable). The setup from that point forward is very easy:

	1. Install Vagrant (version 1.0.5 and later are preferable)
	2. $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/santiagogil/Lost.git your-folder
	3. cd your-folder
	4. $ vagrant up
	5. $ sudo su and then # echo "33.33.33.33  lost.dev" >> /etc/hosts
	5. Wait a few minutes

## Results

* NGINX + PHP responding on IP 33.33.33.33 (in browser, type http://lost.dev)
* MySQL connection available form host machine (*Host*: 33.33.33.33, *User*: root, *Password*: password)

## Known Issues

* In first time you are running the command *vagrant up*, is possible that vagrant will return the following message: "VM must be created before running this command. Run `vagrant up` first." In this case you only need reload the configuration with this command: *vagrant reload*

## What

It's a work in progress, not tested yet.
The proyect concist in building a "LEMP on steroids" specifically tuned for our WordPress deployments.
It will include a lot of config customizations, security sane defaults and monitoring built in.
